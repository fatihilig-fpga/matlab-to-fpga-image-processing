# FPGA-Based Image Processing Algorithms

This repository contains FPGA implementations of common image processing algorithms developed in MATLAB & FPGA (SystemVerilog).  
Each project includes:
- MATLAB reference implementation (matlab_implementation folder) (Dr. Rashi Agarwal  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEo-jHOqGNyUWoCSD3l3V-FjX9PnHvx5n)
- SystemVerilog RTL design & verification Files (not published here for confidentiality)
- Testbench and simulation results (FPGA DESIGN OVERVIEW & RESULTS.md)

## Implemented Algorithms
1. Bit Plane Extraction
2. (Planned)

Each design is written in SystemVerilog and verified using behavioural simulation on Questasim.
