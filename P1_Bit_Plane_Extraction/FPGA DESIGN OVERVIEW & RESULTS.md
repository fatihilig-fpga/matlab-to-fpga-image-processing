## File	Description
- image_if.sv 	: Defines the image stream interface (pixel bus, control, valid signals)

- image_cls.sv	: Implements the bit-plane extraction logic in SystemVerilog
               : Tasks: reset(), display_image_details(), get_image_data(), write_image_data()

## Architecture
![Architecture Schematic](images/architecture_schematic_1.png "System Architecture")

✅ Each input pixel (8-bit grayscale) is streamed into the FPGA.

✅ The design extracts 8 individual bit planes in parallel using bit masking (&) and shifting (>>).

✅ The result can be visualised as 8 binary images, each showing details of a specific significance level.

## Simulation and Verification

The design was simulated with behavioural models to verify:

* Bit-plane accuracy against MATLAB reference

* Correct reconstruction of the original pixel from bit planes

## Verification Flow

1. MATLAB script generates reference bit-plane data.

2. FPGA testbench (tb_image_cls.sv) loads the same pixel stream.

3. Comparison is made between MATLAB and FPGA outputs (byte-accurate).

## Tools Used

- MATLAB — Algorithm reference & validation

- Questasim — Simulation

- SystemVerilog  

- GitHub — Documentation and version tracking
